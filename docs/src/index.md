# Welcome to PADL's documentation!

**Pipeline** abstractions for deep learning.

---

**PADL**:

- is a pipeline builder for **PyTorch**. 
- can be used with all of the great **PyTorch** functionality you're used to for writing layers.
- allows users to build pre-processing, forward passes, loss functions **and** post-processing into the pipeline.
- models may have arbitrary topologies and make use of arbitrary packages from the python ecosystem.
- allows for converting standard functions to **PADL** components using a single keyword `transform`.

**PADL** was developed at [LF1](https://lf1.io/), an AI innovation lab based in Berlin, Germany.
